    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota. I am majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature.</p>

    <h2>Prior experiences:</h2>
    <p>I have participated in two REUs in the past. For the first, it was with the Mathematics Climate Research Network, and I along with two groupmates worked on modeling the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC) with the Stommel Box Model and rapid oscillatory forcings, supervised and helped by Dr. Emmanuel Fleurantin. We then used an ensemble Kalman filter to predict its future trajectory. I continued to work on this together with another groupmate and Dr. Fleurantin, eventually publishing a paper.</p>
    <p>My second REU was with Dr. Carl Lian at Tufts University, and lasted for two months, where two groupmates and I were working on determining if any loop on a ramified cover was braid equivalent to one that breaks. Although we made progress, we did not publish any results, although we did present at the Joint Math Meetings (JMM).</p>
